            When I started my life into the field of Computer Science I got to know about many things, I was <em>confused</em>
            what should i do... But as the time passed I saw many people those who are doing great in their life, I 
            was impressed with their <i>hard-work</i>. I started to explore many field mostly web and app development but I 
            realised my concepts isn't clear , I will always recommend you to guys, if you are going in any field just
            learn the concept and <i>implement</i> it parallely, it's really helpful.

            I like people and mostly poor People, I don't have much friends, I will be so much social When
            I will will reach to my destination. If you know one thing i.e. If you want to reach somewhere 
            then we need to sacrifice many things, because without pay you can't afford any thing. Life is 
            full of ups and down but we should focus on what is right at that moment, don't be a slave of 
            your emotions. Emotions always changes, but the right thing will always be right.
